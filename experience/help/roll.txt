Usage: /roll [number-of-sides]
Rolls a die and presents the result for everyone in the chat to see. The result message is considered an information message (c.f. /help clear).

A die got 6 sides by default, but you can choose an arbitrary number that would befit your requirements. If you want to roll a d20, type:

/roll 20
