Usage: /world world-ID [password] [admin password]
The world-command has two functions: create new worlds as well as connecting to existing worlds. While the world-ID parameter is required in both, password and admin password are optional. You can't change passwords once you've created the world.

CONNECT TO EXISTING WORLDS
All words are assigned unique ID:s upon creation. If you've got the ID:s for an existing world and its passwords, if necessary, you might connect to it. Example: If you want to connect to world ID 2012 and your password is "sealcub", but you do not know the administration password, type the following:

/world 2012 sealcub

Be patient while the window loads your preferences and the history!

CREATE WORLDS
If you want to create a world of your own, provide 0 as the world ID. While passwords and an administrator passwords are optional, it's recommended that you assign them to your world when you create it.

PERSISTENT 
If you're running with "local storage" as the persistent storage mode, your credentials will be stored in the browser for your convenience. You might resume the game at any time by returning to the window and typing /resume.
