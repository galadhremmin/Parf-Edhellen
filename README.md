Coding style
------------
* \t must be replaced with two spaces
* PHP is written in camelCase with exception for classes and interfaces
* SQL is written in upper case
* Always a single space between statements, brackets and paranthesis.

The source code is provided as-is. The code does not, in any shape or form, reflect best coding practices; it's a non-profit hobby project of mine.
