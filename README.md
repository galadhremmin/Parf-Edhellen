This is the source code for [elfdict.com](http://www.elfdict.com), a non-profit, free dictionary online for Tolkien's languages. Maintained by Leonard Wickmark. Follow me on twitter at [@parmaeldo](https://twitter.com/parmaeldo).

Version 25 (model 4.0) is in production.

## Configuration
Installation is relatively easy:
1. Configure the database using the model files. Execute the script files in ascending order, starting with _schema.sql_
2. Shut down your web server
3. Configure your web server to serve the _src/public_ directory. 
4. Make _src/storage_ writeable.
5. Review the application's _.env_ configuration
6. Compile stylesheets and JavaScript assets.
7. Cache sysconfig and routing configuration.
8. Create a symlink to the storage directory (for avatars)

> Always make sure to follow Laravel's guidelines and best practices before moving the app into production.

```
chmod -R o+w project/storage # step 4
cp .env.example .env         # step 5
vim .env                     # step 5
php artisan key:generate      
npm run production           # step 6
php artisan config:cache     # step 7 
php artisan route:cache      # step 7
php artisan storage:link     # step 8
```

## Documentation
### Audit trail
The audit trail consists of activities. Activities are specified as constants within the _App\Models\AuditTrail_ class, and utilised throughout the application. The _App\Repositories\AuditTrailRepository_ contains the necessary functionality for converting activities (which are integers) into human-readable strings.

_Note_: audit trail model objects with the property _is_admin_ set to 1 (= true) can only be seen by administrators.

### Cookies
The following cookie names are used by the application:

| Cookie name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| ed-usermode | Administrators can give a cookie with this name the value _incognito_ to hide their activity. | 

### System errors
The schema _system_errors_ contain information about client-side as well as server-side exceptions. Common exceptions (404 Page not found, 401 Unauthorized, etc.) are separated from the rest by the _is_common_ column. 

Uncaught client-side exceptions are caught by the _onerror_ event, passed to a web API, and logged. Refer to the API documentation for more information.

# Coding style
* \t must be replaced with four spaces for JavaScript and PHP, else two spaces.
* PHP is written in camelCase with exception for classes and interfaces, which are capitalized.
* SQL is written in upper case.
* Always a single space between statements, brackets and paranthesis.
* Curly brackets are positioned on a new line for methods, interfaces and classes, else the first bracket is positioned on the same line as the clause. Example:

      class A
      {
          public function sayHello() 
          {
              if (empty($this->_name)) {
                  echo 'Hello!';
              } else {
                  echo 'Hello, '.$this->_name;
              }
          }
      }
        
 * Conditional operators are restricted to one line, unless the resulting operation is long enough to warrant a split, at which point the first new line is positioned _before_ the question mark, and the second one new line _before_ the colon. Example:
 
      ```function doFruityThings() 
      {
          $fruitName = $fruit instanceof Apple ? 'apple' : 'fruit';
          $customer = $fruit instanceof Apple
              ? FruitVendor::sell($fruit, $appleAdvert, true) 
              : FruitVendor::discard($fruit);
      }
      ```
