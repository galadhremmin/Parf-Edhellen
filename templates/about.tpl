<h2>Welcome to the Parf Edhellen</h2>
The collaborative dictionary for the linguistic world of Tolkien's. Presently in <em>alpha</em>-stage.
<a name="search"></a>
<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>Use the search-box to browse the dictionaries contents. As you type, suggestions are made continously 
based on your enquiry. It is possible to use wildcards to further enhance the quality of these suggestions.</p>

<p>Special characters aren't normalized, which means that you would have to explicitly search for <i>mîr</i> 
or <i>aníra</i> etc. This is a known issue that will be fixed as soon as a viable solution comes to mind.
For the time being, you can use wildcards instead of special characters, if you are uncertain which to use:
<em>m*r</em> and <em>an*ra</em>.</p>

<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p><em>Parf Edhellen</em> does not maintain its own authentication database. Instead, it uses 
<a href="http://openid.net/" target="_blank">OpenID</a> for account management. By logging in using
OpenID, no personal information is compromised and your account names as well as passwords are maintained
independently by each authentication provider. What this site however maintains is an unique ID that identifies
your authenticated account.</p>

<p>The first time you log in, you will be asked to specify an alias. This alias will be your public face and
used for revision management.</p>

<h3>Contributing</h3>
<p>The gist of this website is the strength of aggregated expertise. Your contributions are encouraged,
but please remember to <i>always</i> publish references backing up your claims. Moderators reserve the rights 
to emend and delete content.</p>

<p>There are two ways to contribute: by adding words and by adding glosses. Each word might have multiple
glosses in many languages.</p>

<p>Syntax:<br />
<span class="span-column">[[le]]</span> <a href="index.php#le">le</a><br /> 
<span class="span-column">_mae_</span> <em>mae</em><br /> 
<span class="span-column">*idhron*</span> <u>idhron</u><br /> 
<span class="span-column">&gt;&gt;</span> <img src="img/hand.png" alt="" border="0" /></p>
