<h3>Scroll view &amp; filters</h3> <em>2011-12-11</em>
<p><em>Elfdict</em> has been updated with a new touch-aware scroll view that enables you to flick through the result stack.</p>
<p>You'll find a select box containing languages next to the search field. It is an active filter which determines what kind of 
words in what kind of language that you expect to find within the result stack. Presently, the dictionary has been populated with
words from <em>Sindarin</em>, <em>Noldorin</em>, <em>Quenya</em> and <em>English</em>, of course!</p>

<h3>Result caps</h3> <em>2011-11-09 18:20</em>
<p>The underlying web service that enables <em>Parf Edhellen</em> to function has today been updated with features that are meant to prevent service unavailability. The first step in this direction is a &quot;smart feature&quot; called <em>result caps</em>. Read more about it under the <a href="about.page">About</a> page, under <em>Search</em>.</p>
<p>Measures are undertaken to examine the possibilities to further enhance the navigation experience on handheld devices.</p>
 
<h3>A new, hopefully improved user interface</h3>
<em>2011-11-05 14:53</em>
<p>The <em>Elfdict</em> has been updated with a new user interface designed for productivity and ease of use. The new interaction process is meant to speed up and simplify the way you get the information relevant to you.</p>
<p>The previous auto complete solution was good but hardly optimal, as you'd loose your search query once you chose to click on a specific suggestion. The new user interface lets you survey <em>all</em> results and navigate between them without having to loose your search query. Moreover, using smart key strokes it is easier than ever to move between components.</p>
<p>You'll find a description on how to use it underneath the search result box. Try it out! I hope you'll find it as enjoyable and useful as I do.</p>
