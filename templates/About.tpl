<h2>About <em>Parf Edhellen</em></h2>
<p>The collaborative dictionary dedicated to Tolkien's amazing languages. 

<a name="search"></a>
<h3>Searching</h3>
<p>Use the search field to browse the dictionary. As you type, the dictionary will present suggestions underneath the search field based on what you type. You can use the asterisk symbol (*) to match everything, which can be useful if you're unsure about the spelling of the word you're looking for. A single asterisk won't yield the entire library, however.</p>

<p>Words with special letters, like letters with umlauts and accents, are matched against their their ASCII equivalents. This means that if you search for <i>mir</i>, the dictionary will suggest <i><a href="#m%C3%AEr">mîr</a></i>, <i><a href="#m%C3%ADr%C3%AB">mírë</a></i>, <i><a href="#miril">miril</a></i> etc. </p>

<p>As you type, you'll notice that the list of suggestions can become really long, but there is a cap on how many suggestions you can view at once, depending on the preciseness of your search query. More exact queries (= more letters) are permitted to yield a longer list of suggestions. This feature also exists to improve performance for everyone.</p>

<p>The preciseness of your query is calculated according to the follow equation: 
<br /><u><em>the length of the search term (without white space)</em></u> &times; 200.</p>

<a name="reversed"></a>
<h3>Reversed search</h3>
<p>If you tick the checkbox &quot;reversed search,&quot; matching will be performed backwards. This is useful when you're looking for words with a specific word ending, perhaps with the intention to find fitting rhymes for your poetry.</p>

<a href="unverified"></a>
<h3>Unverified or debatable glosses</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you'll encounter the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span> symbol, usually in conjunction with a warning. These exist to inform you that the gloss might originate from a source which might not have been updated in quite some time. This is unfortunately fairly common because linguistic material on Tolkien's languages are slowly disseminated to the community. Dictionaries like Hiswelókë haven't been updated for years, but they're still excellent.</p>
<p>Would it be a mistake to use words from an outdated source? Probably not. We would recommend you to try to find another source which agrees with the proposed translation. Notwithstanding, all words which come from outdated, unverified or debatable sources have been pushed to the bottom of the page.</p>

<a name="authentication"></a>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>We don't hold usernames and passwords. Instead, we trust Facebook, Google, Twitter and more to do that for us, as we are satisfied as long as they would vouch for you. Therefore, no personal information (apart from your e-mail address in some situation) isn't compromised in the event of a breach. So logging in is simple: choose which community/provider you would like to confirm your identity with, and log in there. Once you've logged in, and given <em>Parf Edhellen</em> permission to read basic information from your user profile, you'll be sent back to elfdict.com, where you'll be asked to choose a nickname for yourself.</p>
<p>To identify you in the future, elfdict.com saves your e-mail address and an unique identifier (a long, random-looking string of letters) which your provider gave to us.</p>
